# Eclipse Phase 2 Muse (EP2-Muse) #

----------
# Description #

**Live:** [https://ep2-muse.herokuapp.com/](https://ep2-muse.herokuapp.com/ "https://ep2-muse.herokuapp.com/")

Eclipse Phase 2 Muse is a tool to allow players of the [Eclipse Phase](https://eclipsephase.com/ "Eclipse Phase") roleplaying game to look up game information and create basic characters sheets for new characters of the game.

This project was initially taken as a capstone project for a software engineering bootcamp, but will be maintained and updated over time.

# Features #

EP2-Muse currently has two main features: 

- **Compendium** - The Compendium is a database of character, gear, skills, and attributes that users can use to look up information as needed. Users can navigate by gear or attribute type and get more information about that item.

- **Character Sheets** - EP2-Muse also allows users to create new characters using the ***Add Character*** option and view their created character sheets using ***My Characters***. The character sheet creation features will automatically populate attributes and stats based on the choices the user makes for their characters.

The compendium lookup and character sheet features are the main focus of the application, as the goal is to provide an easy way for users to find information they need and create character sheets without extensive knowledge of game rules.

EP2-Muse also makes use of BCrypt to hash passwords and store user accounts, which allows characters to be linked to specific users. This lets users both view only their own characters while keeping them safe from other users.

# Technologies #

EP-2 Muse makes use of a [custom API](https://ep2-data-api.herokuapp.com/ "custom API") I built using data from [Arokha's EP-2 Data project](https://github.com/Arokha/EP2-Data "Arokha's EP-2 Data project").

The following technology has been used to create EP2-Muse:

- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
- Javascript/AJAX
- Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy/WTForms/Requests
- PostgreSQL/Gunicorn
